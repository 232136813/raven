Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Raven project. There
are quite a few ways in which you can contribute to make the project better,
these guidelines are in place to help everyone communicate these changes as
best as they can.

Note that all contributors are subject to
[Folktale's code of conduct](http://folktalejs.org/community/code-of-conduct.html).

## Reporting an issue

If you find something that you consider to be an issue with the project, please
[create an issue on the relevant GitHub project tracker][issue]. Opening an issue means
you're up to talk to us about the problem so we can solve it.

When reporting an issue, please try to provide as much information as you can
so that we can understand the problem. This usually means:

 -  The version of the project;
 -  The operating system, version, and architecture (Windows 8, OS/X Mountain Lion, Ubuntu 14.04 64bit, ...);
 -  If possible and relevant, a test case that reproduces the problem;

## Contributing a feature or fix

If you want to provide a patch for an issue or add a new feature to a project,
there are also a few guidelines that can help us communicate better. All
projects use [Git](http://git-scm.com/). If you want to get more familiar with
the tool, you can try the freely available
[Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book).

In a nutshell, the workflow goes like this:

 -  Fork the project on GitHub, so you have commit access to it;
 -  Create a feature branch (e.g.: patch-issue-1234);
 -  Do your changes and test them (`make test`);
 -  Make a pull request with your changes;

A Pull Request is mainly a way of getting feedback about your changes and
starting a discussion about them before merging it on the main branch.
