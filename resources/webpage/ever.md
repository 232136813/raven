## Prologue

"Do you believe in miracles?"

That phrase haunted my mind over and over again since the time I first heard it. It was not the question itself that bothered me, but something else. The definition of miracle, to be more precise. I, Summer Hughes, had no idea of what the person who asked me this question meant by "miracle," so I could not give them any answer.

Was it "Can impossible things happen?" I don't think that was the case.

## Chapter I

"Summer!" The usual effusive voice greets me as I set my foot in the Imagine media agency. Turning my head towards the source of that overtly happy greeting, I see a young blonde girl carrying two cups of coffee with a big smile on her face. "I also bought cake today," She added as she passed me and walked towards the cafeteria, "Don't you dare keep me waitin' ya hear?" And finished with a little teasing.

I giggled and followed the enthusiastic girl to the cafeteria. "You wanted mocha, right?" She asked as I approached the table. Nodding, I took my seat and glanced through the things she bought today: coffee and strawberry shortcake. Now that's most definitely what every healthy girl should be eating first-thing in the morning. "These look particularly delicious," I said, after finishing my hurried inspection of the sweets. Satisfied with my response, she smiled and started digging in. Not wanting to lose any more precious seconds I followed.

"They're so soft and tasty. Is this from that bakery we passed by yesterday?" The girl nodded. Even though she was such a carefree and meddlesome person, she still minded her manners and behaved somewhat properly at the table. "God, I need to grab more of these today. I've ended up eating all of my chocolates and..." I stopped, pondering whether to bother her with such problems, "No, it's nothing. Nevermind." Then decided it was better not to do that.

Sure friends were supposed to count on each other and have each other's back when they're facing all sorts of problems. That's really fine for friends. The problem here is that: we were not. I, Summer Hughes, had only been in this agency for a couple of weeks, and I barely knew the chatty girl in front of me (believe me, she is awfully chatty when she's not eating sweets). But luckily, Julie Evans was one of those people who could go from complete stranger to your best friend forever in ten seconds.

So, to sum things up: while Julie might consider me her friend, to me she is merely an acquaintance. A really good acquaintance that treats me to cakes and coffees all the time, but an acquaintance none the less. And because of this I wouldn't really feel comfortable opening myself to her just after we met. We hardly knew each other, although she was awfully open about certain subjects, I am pretty sure that she herself doesn't think our relationship achieved that level of confidence where she could just go about telling me about her personal problems.

Still, moments like these where we got together to eat sweets and discuss the most trivial matters of the entire universe where pretty good. A fairly contrasting change from my previous job, where I was surrounded by men all day and was hardly even treated like a human being. Men are seriously disgusting.

"...ke, and..." When I came to myself Julie was gesticulating excessively and talking about something I hadn't the slightiest clue of. "Did you even listen to a word I said?" She pouted, and finished drinking her coffee. Funny thing she loved sweet things, but preferred her coffee bitter and black. She was sort of an unpredictable girl in that sense.

"Sorry." I apologised, "I kind of lost myself on my own thoughts here." Then, opening up a smile and shifting my attention to her, added, "So, what was it you were saying?"

She sighed, "My, you're hopeless." For a second she looked like she was going to scold me--- but only for a slice of second. The next instant she was back to her old happy-go-lucky self, going about her life disadventures. Like how there was this time she entered the men bathroom by mistake, and just wanted to hang herself with shame. Or how she was so bad with directions that she managed to get herself lost and be late for a meeting with her old high-school friends. Trivial life things.

When she was done telling me those things, she stopped for a moment, then her face brightened and she said, "Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever invited you to the karaoke. Even though we went to one last week." And she looked somewhat sad for that, as if she was trying to come up with an excuse for not inviting me.

"Ah, it's okay." I reassured her, "I'm not a big fan of singing anyway. Though my mother used to be a music teacher, and made me take a few singing classes when I was younger, it never really felt that great. Not that I hate it either, though."

"Oh, your mom is a music teacher? First I've heard o' that." Julie said, and quickly added, "Is tonight okay for ya?"

I must have raised my eyebrows without knowing, since Julie hurried to add, "Oh, I mean, the karaoke. I was thinkin' we could hit it tonight. I mean, it's friday and all, an' we ain't got much left to do for today, right?"

"Oh," I pondered for a moment if I should take her up on the offer or not. I didn't really have anything against hanging out, and specially, I didn't have anything against hanging out with a gorgeous girl like her, but... "Ah, I guess I'm pretty much free today. Who else is coming?"

"Jus' ya an' me," she opened up a large smile, and then I must have made another weird expression, for her face changed to a worried expression and she waved her hands in the air saying, "O-Oh, I mean, if that's a problem I can invite more people too. I mean..."

"Nah, it's okay, really." And with that she calmed down a little bit. "It just caught me by surprise since we barely know each other." And realising that she could take that phrase to mean something I didn't want her to think of me, I added, "And you're always hanging out with a lot of people as well, so..."

Julie gave me a troubled smile, "Yeah..." and she looked like she was going to start crying. Did I really cause that bad of an impression? "Sorry, it's just... a lot of things happen'd lately. An' I really like ya as well. Yer nice to talk to, and don't try preyin' so much in my life." She chuckled. "Sounds like I'm jus' talkin' ill of ya, eh?"

"No." I was taken aback. I didn't expect her to be so straightforward. "No, not at all. I was just not expecting it, that's all." And smiled, in the hopes she'd brighten up a little bit, "So, hanging out to sing our worries out and ignore the world for tonight? I'm all for it!" And it worked. Although her expression wasn't the brightiest of all, she reminded me more of the cheerful Julie I met. And I was glad for that.

\* \* \*

It wasn't until a few minutes past 5 in the afternoon that I saw Julie again. We were running slightly late with the project and I had a deadline to make, "I'm still kinda busy here, you see." Contrary to the reaction I was expecting, the girl just opened a smile and said, "Yeah I know. This project is madness." I nodded. They definitely could get a more generous deadline, we were rushing things so much here, and by the look of it, it would be another two or three hours until I could finally go home. 

"So I talked to the manager about it, and she called one of the stakeholders. She kinda begged 'em, but managed to shift the deadline to next week." She added, with a proud expression. "Looks like we won't be able to change the deadline again though, so we might still have to cram up a little bit. But at least we're okay for now, I think."  

It took a few seconds for the dumbfounded me to acknowledge what she was saying and give a proper reply, "Oh, that's great." In other words, I could finally go home.

"So, yer ready to rock things out at the karaoke?" She asked. The karaoke, I had completely forgot about it. Looks like it's really going to be a couple or so of hours until I'm able to go home and relax, in the end. I sighed. With that, Julie added "Ah, you don't want to go after all." Her expression showed that she was fairly disappointed.

"Ah, no, I'm totally coming." I said, although I could not really fake any enthusiasm. So I decided it was better to just be straightforward with her. "I'm just a bit tired and was thinking it would be nice to get home and relax. But I guess I could use the company, and some alcohol as well. I don't really drink too often but it does make me forget my everyday worries in the rare times I do."

"It's decided, then!" She tried to sound like her usual cheerful self, but failed miserably. It showed on her expression that whatever it was that was troubling her was being a huge weight on her shoulders.

Once I finished saving all the work I was doing and getting the things on the company's servers, I turned off the computer, grabbed my bag, and joined Julie on the way out of the agency. Outside it was a little bit chillier than I was expecting. It was the start of the British autumn, so it wasn't really cold, just the kind of weather you could get comfortable by with a cardigan and some tights. Which was, in fact, the look of the girl walking by my side in the streets. A cute blue cardigan, white tops, black skirt, and equally black tights. And she did look rather pretty, with her wavy blonde hair falling just below her shoulders, long eyelashes contrasting with the blue eyes and pale skin. Petit and symmetric features.

Not that I was in love with her or anything, but she was kind of my type of girl. Unfortunately, _my type of girl_ usually came with the sad characteristic of being straight as fuck. In this case, she was also in a long term relationship with her boyfriend. Luck-in-love and I didn't seem to get along that well.

"Did you watch that song contest show yesterday?" She was the first one to strike up a conversation as we walked down over to where she had parked her car. "I really liked that soprano singer. I wish I could sing like that. So ethereal, yet so powerful. The song she choose was particularly good too."

"It was quite moving, indeed. I only caught a part of the show, though." She turned right into another road, and we entered the old parking building. While we walked, I noticed that the carefree Julie wasn't really there with me. Not just in the way she spoke, but the expression I stole a glance at from time to time wasn't what I would describe as _happy_. "I'm not really much of a fan of TV shows though. I just caught it by chance. I was walking down to the kitchen to make supper and my mother called me to watch it."

Julie smiled. "Sounds like the kind of thing a music teacher would be interested in watching." She said as we got into the car. I nodded, and added, "Yeah, she was enjoying it quite a bit. But the singer was pretty good too. Since she did use to be an Opera soprano singer, I can see why she'd be that happy. Probably reminded her of her old days."

"Your mother used to be an Opera singer?" Julie said, truly amused, as she started out the car. "My, your family sounds actually pretty amazing. I didn't expect you to still be living with your parents though." She added, a little surprised.

"For now, yes. I'm looking for a place to rent though." Julie's expression brightened as she rememebered something. "Oh, yeah. I do remember you asking me if I knew of any nice place renting." I gave her a disappointed smile. "Things have been... a little too busy on my side, and although it might not look like that, I'm a fairly forgetful person. It's been worse these days though."

"No worries," was all I managed to said in that awkward situation. Julie drove for a few kilometers until we reached the karaoke downtown. The small amount of words we exchanged could only be considered chit-chat. And although I did not have anything against that, and could enjoy chit-chat from time to time, something was clearly bothering her and I did not know how to react to that. Julie did say she was hanging out with me because I wasn't a meddlesome girl, but this was starting to get to me.

_(Describe how they will interact with the karaoke staff here. Might be interesting, dunno)_

When we reached the room, Julie threw herself on the sofa. She looked a little bit happier than before, and I ended up smiling unconsciously at that sight. "Do you want to sing now or order something?" She asked, as she browsed through the catalogue. "You can go ahead," I said, grabbing the menu, "I think I'll order a drink first."

"Riiiight," Julie got up, and walked towards me as I took my seat on the sofa, then wrapped her arms around me and whispered, "You could definitely use the alcohol, Miss Workaholic." I raised my eyebrows. Workaholic? Me? Looking satisfied with all the teasing, she added, "You do look pretty stiff," and went back to browsing the catalogue.

Maybe she was right, and I was just a worrywart. Definitely not a workaholic, though. I sighed and went back to looking at the drinks. A couple of minutes later I decided for two _margerittas_. When I ordered, the blue eyes followed me with an inquiring look. "I'm not drinking alone, you know." She giggled and smiled a little. "And you need to relax a little as well," I added, and she nodded with a satisfied expression.

I think I'll start with "Let it go," then. We sang for hours. Julie's selection of songs were all from modern pop culture, and she still managed to miss all the notes, which left me a bit disappointed with her tastes and choice of a karaoke for hanging out. But she was happy, and we even got to sing a duet. All in all, one could say that night was a win for both of us.

"Would you mind keeping me company for a little while longer?" She said as we left the room, with a hint of sadness in her voice, then quickly added, "I'll take you home afterwards, of course." Since I wasn't expecting that after all the laughs we had in the karaoke, I stole a glance at her face. Her eyes seemed distant, as if she was lost in her own thoughts. I could only nod.

Julie drove to a nearby park. I hadn't been to this part of the city before, but the atmosphere was quite soothing. We sat on a bench beneath a huge tree and the moon after buying some canned coffee at a vending machine laying close by. I let myself stare at the sky for a couple of seconds. The moon was full in the sky, and there were no clouds as far as the eyes could see. The kind of atmosphere that could make you forget about your problems for a little while. And maybe that was the reason we just stood there, motionless, in silence, for what looked like eternity.

"Hey..." Julie broke the silence as she opened her coffee, "do you believe in miracles?" The question was so out of the blue that I didn't really know how to answer. I didn't get the feeling that she was actually expecting an answer from me, so I remained silent.

"If you want someone to listen, I'm here for you. We haven't known each other for long, and it's not like we're close friends or anything. But I guess I've taken a liking to you, and I've gotten to care about you quite a bit." She let out a shy smile at those words, but it quickly faded.

"You know how, sometimes, things don't really go the way you expected them to." I nodded. That happened to me quite frequently. "It has been like this my whole life, and I'm not sure what I should do anymore." She made a pause for what seemed like a whole minute. Julie was pressing the can of coffee hard. "I'm not sure I can do anything anymore."

With nothing to say, I pulled her closer and let her head rest on my shoulders. At that instant, the tears she was trying so hard to hold back came flowing down. "I'm sorry..." She whispered, and with the shock I cried, "You have nothing to apologise for!" And just as quickly I recomposed myself and added, "Sorry for yelling, but you really don't need to apologise anything to me. I told you, I'll be here to listen to you, if you want to talk. I don't want to pressure you into talking either, we're not close friends--- though even if we were I'd still feel bad for doing something like that."

We stood there in awkward silence while Julie cried her worries away. She tried to tell me about the problem a handful of times, all of them in vague words like _"Could one really defy fate and change their destiny?" _I wondered if her problem really was that hopeless, but more than that, I was worried she was blaming herself for everything that wasn't under her control.

I knew that blaming yourself over things you have no control over would lead nowhere besides getting yourself broken. And I didn't want her to end up like me four years ago. On the other hand, I didn't really know how to help her out of this mess either.

I felt useless. And with that feeling I clutched my hands. I got mad at myself because I could only stand there, seeing her cry and blame herself.

"I..." She said, after a while, "I guess... I ended up ruinin' yer night after all." And getting up, she dried her tears and forced a laugh. I smiled, "You really haven't. I had plenty of fun at the karaoke. And, you know, what I said before, I really meant it."

Julie smiled. I couldn't really tell if it was a genuine smile or one out of concern for me, but it was still a beautiful smile. She took two steps towards me and grabbed my hands, saying, "So, shall we get going? I'll drop ya at yer place, as I promised." I nodded, and she started pulling me to the car. 

For a moment, I felt like we were sisters, holding hands so we wouldn't get separated while walking around the town. Or maybe, holding hands because we didn't want the other to sink. We wanted to keep pulling towards the surface. Was that just my wishful thinking, I wondered. Either way, I had decided to look out for Julie. To help her however I could.
